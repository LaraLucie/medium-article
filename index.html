    <h4>⭐️ The Hubble Telescope ⭐️</h4>
    <p>
      Named in honor of the trailblazing astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope is a large, space-based observatory, which has revolutionized astronomy since its launch and deployment by the space shuttle Discovery in 1990.
      Far above rain clouds, light pollution, and atmospheric distortions, Hubble has a crystal-clear view of the universe.
      Scientists have used Hubble to observe some of the most distant stars and galaxies yet seen, as well as the planets in our solar system.

    <h4>What did Hubble see today? - The Cat's Eye Nebula 🔭 🔭 🔭</h4>
    <p>Produced by a dying star, the Cat's Eye Nebula is one of the most complex planetary nebulas known.
      This image reveals a pattern of concentric rings around the central star.
      Each "ring" is actually the edge of a spherical bubble of material ejected by the star.
